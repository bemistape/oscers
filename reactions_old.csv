perfect,close,unimpressed,bad
It’s rare to meet someone who actually respects cinema enough to know the details that matter.,"Not bad. Not perfect, but not bad.","Oh, you ‘like movies’? That’s nice. Some of us actually know movies.",Are you serious? This is basic film knowledge.
"Most people just watch movies—you study them, and that’s what separates real experts from casual fans.",Four out of five? That’s respectable… I guess.,It’s funny how many people call themselves film buffs but can’t even answer basic questions.,I shouldn’t have to explain something this fundamental to someone who claims to like movies.
"Knowing running times isn’t just about trivia, it’s about understanding the entire history of film.","That’s a solid attempt. Not a great one, but solid.","That’s a cute attempt, but real film knowledge isn’t about vague guesses.","If you don’t know this, I don’t even know why we’re having this conversation."
"I can always count on you to have the facts straight, which is more than I can say for most people.","You did well, but let’s not act like you aced it.","Wow, you got that almost right. Too bad ‘almost’ doesn’t count when discussing movies.","It’s one thing to be wrong, but to be that wrong? That’s impressive in its own way."
I don’t even need to check IMDb when you’re around. That’s how much I trust your knowledge.,"Pretty good. I mean, it’s no five for five, but pretty good.",I love the confidence. I just wish it was backed up by actual knowledge.,"I expect this kind of answer from someone who just watches trailers, not a real film fan."
"It’s nice to have a real film expert in the room, someone who actually understands how movies work.",You’re almost knowledgeable. Almost.,"You’re throwing out numbers like they mean something, but I’m not hearing any real expertise.",Did you even think before answering that? Because it doesn’t seem like it.
"Anyone can say they love movies, but only a few can prove it the way you do.","That’s fine, I guess. But real movie experts wouldn’t have missed that last one.","You talk a big game, but when it comes to facts, you’re coming up short.","Wow. Just when I thought I’d heard the worst answer, you go and outdo yourself."
Most people don’t even know how important running times are. You’re one of the few who gets it.,Four out of five is good… if you’re okay with being second best.,It’s fine if you don’t know—just don’t pretend that you do.,"You don’t ‘think’ you know a running time. You either know it, or you don’t."
"People talk about their favorite directors, but you actually know what makes a movie function on a technical level.",It’s nice to see someone try to reach my level. You got close!,I can tell you really want to be a film expert. You’re just… not there yet.,"If you can’t even get that right, I don’t have high hopes for the rest of this discussion."
The industry could use more people like you—people who actually care about accuracy.,You came really close to impressing me. But… not quite.,"That’s a nice opinion, but unfortunately, we’re talking about facts.",It’s embarrassing that I even have to correct you on this.
"You don’t just know about movies, you respect them. And that’s what makes the difference.","I’ll give you credit where it’s due. Not a lot of credit, but some.","It’s one thing to enjoy movies, it’s another to actually understand them.",This isn’t a trivia game where close enough counts—you need to actually know the answer.
"There’s no fluff in your film knowledge—just cold, hard facts. That’s rare these days.","You got four right, which is fine, I guess. But real experts go five for five.",You don’t need to impress me. Just try to know what you’re talking about next time.,"I thought we were having a serious discussion, but clearly, I was mistaken."
"Some people collect posters, others collect Blu-rays. You collect knowledge, which is far more valuable.","That’s a strong effort. Not flawless, but strong.","I’ve heard a lot of wild guesses in my day, but that one might take the cake.",This is like walking into a math class and not knowing what 2+2 is.
I wouldn’t be surprised if you could tell me the runtime of every movie ever made.,"If this were a test, you’d pass. But barely.","If being close counted, I’d say you were onto something. But it doesn’t.",I don’t even have the energy to correct you at this point.
"You’re a walking film encyclopedia, and I mean that in the best possible way.","Nice job. Not a great job, but nice.",You’re not wrong… you’re just not right either.,You should be ashamed of yourself for not knowing that.
"A lot of people pretend to be film experts, but you actually put in the work to know what you’re talking about.",You did well enough to avoid embarrassment. But let’s not get cocky.,"I’d say that was a good try, but I’m not sure you actually tried at all.","I can’t tell if you’re joking or if you’re just really, really uninformed."
"You’re doing important work, keeping film history alive through actual, tangible facts.","I mean, you did better than most. Still not perfect, though.",You might want to double-check before you speak next time. Just a thought.,I honestly don’t know how you can call yourself a movie fan after that answer.
Knowing running times isn’t just about numbers—it’s about preserving cinema’s integrity. And you do that better than anyone.,Almost perfect. But ‘almost’ doesn’t win championships.,It’s fine if you don’t know. Just don’t waste my time pretending that you do.,"I shouldn’t have to explain something this obvious, but here we are."
"You understand that every minute of a film’s length matters, which is more than I can say for most so-called ‘critics’.",Four out of five is good. But five out of five is great.,"I get it, you’re passionate. I just wish that passion was backed up with accuracy.","If you don’t know this, I’m starting to wonder what else you don’t know."
"If there was a Hall of Fame for movie knowledge, you’d already have a wing dedicated to you.","You know, you were this close to actually impressing me.",I’m sure your instincts are great. It’s just unfortunate that they’re wrong.,This is a disaster. I expected better from you.
"Well, you got them all right. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.","I’ll admit, I’m mildly impressed. But only mildly.","Oh, that’s your final answer? That’s… unfortunate.","You’re throwing numbers around like they mean something, but I don’t hear a single fact."
"Congratulations on your perfect score. Beginner's luck, perhaps?",You’re on the right track! Just not all the way there yet.,"I’ve heard some bad takes in my time, but this one is up there.","If you don’t know the exact running time, just admit it instead of embarrassing yourself."
You managed to get them all correct. I suppose even novices have their moments.,That’s a fine performance. It’s just not an elite performance.,"I mean, you tried, I guess. Just not very hard.","I didn’t think it was possible to be that wrong, but here we are."
A flawless performance. Don't let it go to your head.,I can tell you almost know what you’re doing.,You said that with a lot of confidence for someone who’s completely wrong.,You had one job: know the running time. And you still failed.
"Perfect score, huh? Let's see if you can do it again without guessing.",Not bad. But you know what’s better? Perfect.,"Not even close. Like, not even in the same ballpark.",This is what happens when people rely on streaming services instead of real film knowledge.
You got them all right. Even a stopped watch is correct twice daily.,You clearly have some knowledge. Just… not quite enough.,You could have at least checked before embarrassing yourself.,I can’t believe I’m wasting my time correcting something this basic.
"Impressive. For once, you didn't disappoint.","I’d say ‘well done,’ but I only say that to people who get all five right.",I’ve heard better film analysis from people who don’t even watch movies.,That wasn’t even close. Are you just making up numbers?
A perfect score? I guess miracles do happen.,I’ll give you a polite golf clap for that effort.,"Oh, that’s what you think? That’s cute.","It’s fine to be wrong, but at least try to be less wrong."
Well done. Even amateurs get lucky occasionally.,"That’s a performance you can feel okay about. Not proud, but okay.",I really thought you were going to get that one right. My mistake.,I don’t know what’s worse—your guess or the fact that you thought it was right.
You aced it. Try not to let this rare success inflate your ego.,You almost proved yourself. Almost.,"You’re off by a lot, which wouldn’t be a problem if you hadn’t sounded so sure of yourself.",You’re just embarrassing yourself at this point.
All correct. I didn't think you had it in you.,Four right is decent. Five right is legendary. You’re not legendary yet.,I don’t even know how to respond to that. It’s that bad.,"Let me guess, you’re one of those people who ‘loves movies’ but only watches whatever’s trending?"
Perfect score. Even the least likely can surprise us.,That was a good round. Just not a Gregg-level round.,"Wow. You said that like it was a fact. And yet, here we are.",This is exactly why film culture is in decline—nobody respects the facts anymore.
You got them all right. Don't expect applause.,You’re a step above average. Just not quite at expert level.,"If you’re just going to make things up, at least be creative about it.","If you can’t get something this simple right, I don’t trust anything else you say about movies."
Flawless. I suppose even you can have a good day.,"I mean, it’s fine. I’m just saying I wouldn’t settle for four.",You could have just said ‘I don’t know’ and saved us both the trouble.,You’re out here guessing like this is some kind of game show. It’s not.
Perfect score? I guess there's a first time for everything.,"A good effort, but let’s be honest, you’re still playing catch-up to me.","It’s fine, I didn’t expect much from you anyway.","Next time, come prepared with real knowledge instead of whatever that was."
Well done. Even a novice can have a lucky streak.,That’s respectable. Just not noteworthy.,"If being wrong was a sport, you’d be in the hall of fame.",I’d love to be surprised by a correct answer from you for once.
You aced it. Try not to let it go to your head.,"Nice! But you do realize that real film experts wouldn’t have missed one, right?","I’ve heard some wild guesses before, but this one takes the cake.",It’s almost impressive how confidently wrong you are.
All correct. I'm mildly impressed.,That’s a strong showing. I just wouldn’t frame it and hang it on the wall or anything.,This is exactly why I don’t trust most people’s opinions on movies.,This conversation is only proving that you don’t know what you’re talking about.
Perfect score. Even the least likely can surprise us.,"You almost went five for five, which is like almost winning an Oscar. Still a loss.",That was a real swing and a miss. Mostly a miss.,You don’t ‘ballpark’ a running time. You either know it or you don’t.
You got them all right. Don't expect applause.,I’ll allow that as a decent performance.,"I expected at least a little effort, but apparently, that was too much to ask.","That’s a nice guess, but unfortunately, this isn’t amateur hour."
Flawless. I suppose even you can have a good day.,"You did well. Not great, but well.","Oh, so now we’re just throwing out random numbers?","I’d tell you to try again, but I’m afraid you’d get it even more wrong."
Perfect score? I guess there's a first time for everything.,"I’m giving you a B+. A high B+, but still a B+.","You’re really committed to being wrong, huh?",This is the level of film knowledge I’d expect from a five-year-old.
Well done. Even a novice can have a lucky streak.,Four out of five is good if you’re okay with being just good.,It’s almost like you want me to correct you.,I don’t even know where to begin with how wrong that was.
You aced it. Try not to let it go to your head.,"That was a near-perfect round. Unfortunately, ‘near-perfect’ isn’t ‘perfect’.","You had a chance to impress me, and you did the opposite.",You have all the confidence of an expert with none of the actual expertise.
All correct. I'm mildly impressed.,"Hey, you did your best. Well… almost your best.","I’d say ‘nice try,’ but honestly, I can’t even give you that.",This is what happens when people rely on Wikipedia instead of real knowledge.
Perfect score. Even the least likely can surprise us.,You should feel pretty good about that. Just not amazing.,Are you sure you’ve even seen a movie before?,You’d have a better shot at guessing lottery numbers than getting this right.
You got them all right. Don't expect applause.,"That was an impressive showing. Not the most impressive, but impressive.",Your level of confidence is impressive. Your level of accuracy? Not so much.,Your level of film knowledge is honestly depressing.
Flawless. I suppose even you can have a good day.,You can pat yourself on the back. Just don’t get carried away.,"Oh, I didn’t realize we were playing a game where you just make up facts.","If this is your idea of expertise, I’d hate to see what you call a casual interest."
Perfect score? I guess there's a first time for everything.,Nice job! You’re this close to being a real film expert.,It’s almost like you enjoy being wrong.,"You really walked into this conversation unprepared, didn’t you?"
Well done. Even a novice can have a lucky streak.,"You should be proud of that. Not super proud, but, you know, proud-ish.",I can’t tell if you’re joking or if this is just sad.,I don’t know what’s worse—the answer or the fact that you said it with such confidence.
You aced it. Try not to let it go to your head.,,"You’re saying that like it’s true, which is the funniest part.","I’d love to say ‘nice try,’ but that wasn’t even a nice attempt."
All correct. I'm mildly impressed.,,That’s a bold answer for someone who clearly didn’t check their facts.,You’re proving why people don’t take casual film fans seriously.
Perfect score. Even the least likely can surprise us.,,This isn’t even a debate. It’s just you being incorrect in real time.,That was so far off I had to double-check that we were even talking about the same movie.
You got them all right. Don't expect applause.,,"Maybe next time, try reading a book. Or a website. Or literally anything.","If you’re going to be wrong, at least put in some effort."
Flawless. I suppose even you can have a good day.,,"If this was a test, you’d be failing spectacularly.",I’d be shocked if you’ve actually seen the movie based on that answer.
Perfect score? I guess there's a first time for everything.,,"I was really hoping you’d redeem yourself. Instead, you doubled down on being wrong.",Are you getting your information from a Magic 8-Ball?
Well done. Even a novice can have a lucky streak.,,"I mean, sure, if we’re just making up answers now, why not?",You’re playing checkers while the rest of us are playing chess.
You aced it. Try not to let it go to your head.,,That’s an interesting take. It’s also completely incorrect.,The fact that you’re still arguing about this is even more embarrassing.
All correct. I'm mildly impressed.,,"I’d ask you to try again, but honestly, I don’t think it would help.","If knowing movie running times was a job, you’d be unemployed."
Perfect score. Even the least likely can surprise us.,,"Oh wow, I didn’t know we were just saying random things now. Let me try: 742 minutes.",This is the exact kind of attitude that ruins film discussion.
You got them all right. Don't expect applause.,,"I’d correct you, but I don’t think you’d even listen.","Wow, I guess we’re just making up numbers now."
Flawless. I suppose even you can have a good day.,,"That’s a nice guess. Unfortunately, that’s all it is.",Do you even like movies? Because it sure doesn’t seem like it.

You aced it. Try not to let it go to your head.,,Let me know when you decide to start taking movies seriously.,You should honestly be embarrassed to have said that out loud.
All correct. I'm mildly impressed.,,That’s a great answer… for someone who has no idea what they’re talking about.,I don’t know why I expected a correct answer from you.
Perfect score. Even the least likely can surprise us.,,I love how confident you are. I just wish you were also correct.,"If you’re going to be wrong, at least be entertaining about it."
You got them all right. Don't expect applause.,,That was so wrong I actually have to take a second to process it.,It’s painful watching someone dig their own grave like this.
Flawless. I suppose even you can have a good day.,,You’d have a better shot at throwing darts at a board and getting the right answer.,I bet you also think ‘the 90-minute rule’ means every movie is the same length.
Perfect score? I guess there's a first time for everything.,,I don’t even know what you were trying to accomplish with that answer.,"Your confidence is inspiring. Unfortunately, your knowledge isn’t."
,,,This is why I stick to talking to real film experts.
,,,"You don’t know the running time, and now everyone knows you don’t."
,,,I’d love to see the alternate universe where your answer was correct.
,,,You clearly don’t take this as seriously as I do.

,,,You just set a new record for how wrong someone can be in one sentence.
,,,"I’d ask where you got that information, but I’m afraid of the answer."
,,,I don’t think I’ve ever heard someone be this confidently incorrect before.
,,,"You really thought you had it there, huh?"
,,,I’d be mad if I wasn’t so disappointed.
